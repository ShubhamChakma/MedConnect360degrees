I want you to generate a clean, modern React-based UI (can be in JSX or HTML+Tailwind) for an AI-powered medical chatbot named **Dr. Nova**.

🧠 Purpose:
Dr. Nova is a friendly + knowledgeable chatbot that performs intelligent health triage. It takes natural language symptom input from users and responds with:
- A probable medical condition
- Severity level (Low / Medium / High)
- Recommendation (Home Remedy, Telemedicine, or OPD visit)
- Optional health tips
- Clear visual indicators (like emoji or icons)

💬 Chat UI Requirements:
- ChatGPT-like layout (user messages on right, Dr. Nova messages on left)
- Typing animation (like “Dr. Nova is typing…” with animated dots)
- Use a calm, trustworthy color scheme (green/blue-themed)
- Include icons or emojis for severity and medical clarity:
    - 🟢 Low, 🟠 Medium, 🔴 High
    - 🏠 Home Care, 🏥 OPD Visit
    - 🧠 Condition, 📊 Severity, 🧾 Recommendation
- Display welcome message at the top:  
  _"Hi, I'm Dr. Nova, your personal AI health assistant. Please tell me what symptoms you're experiencing today."_  
- Chat bubbles should auto-scroll to latest message.
- Include a simple text input field with a "Send" button.
- Optional: Add a "Why this diagnosis?" button to explain Dr. Nova's response.
- Optional: Include a CTA button like “Book OPD Appointment” if severity is High.

📁 Other notes:
- Code should be structured and componentized if possible (like ChatWindow, MessageBubble, TypingDots)
- Feel free to use TailwindCSS for styling.
- Do not connect to backend for now — just dummy responses and messages for the UI mock.

🚀 Goal:
Create a functional and visually rich chatbot interface that looks like a real AI triage assistant used in a medical app. Keep tone friendly, informative, and human.
